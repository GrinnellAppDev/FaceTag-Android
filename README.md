Play tag with your friends. Tag them by taking a photo of their face!

###About

FaceTag is a fun game for Android and iOS. Developed at MHacks Winter 2014.

Description:
Set up a game with your friends and specify the duration of the game (time or points). All people will begin the game as "it" and will be given a target to tag! The first person to get a picture of their target's face gets a point; the other people who are "it" do not.

Game Rules:

1. Find your target and acquire a picture with their face clearly visible.

2. Picture cannot be a picture of a picture.

3. Other hunters will confirm that the picture is an original picture.
